# UFOs

## Project Overview
A data journalist would like to see a dynamic webpage that allows users to be able to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. This webpage specifically deals with UFO sightings data stored in a JavaScript array. 

## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: Python 3.9.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.59.0

## Summary 
Overall, this webpage does what it is intended to do, however, one major drawback is that the search is case sensitive. Since people typically capitalize proper nouns such as city names and initials for state and country, this design might not be the most intuitive. A few other features I would add to make searching easier include adding a drop-down feature for each search criteria and a button to clear filters out.
